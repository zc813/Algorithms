# Leetcode

## Brief Introduction

Hi! This repository consists of two parts:

1. My solutions to some of the Leetcode problems. These solutions are optimal at time complexity.

2. Implementation of some classic algorithms and solutions, such as Heap Sort, Binary Max-heap, Longest Common Subsequences, etc. (some of which already implemented in C++ STL)

Hope you'll like it!
