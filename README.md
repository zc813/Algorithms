# Leetcode

## Brief Introduction

Hi! This repository consists of two parts:

1. My solutions to some of the Leetcode problems. These solutions are optimal at time complexity.

2. Besides Leetcode problems, there are also implementation of some classic algorithms and problems, such as Heap Sort, Binary Max-heap, Longest Common Subsequences, etc. (some of which already implemented in C++ STL)

Hope you'll like it!
